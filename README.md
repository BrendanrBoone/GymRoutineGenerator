# GymRoutineGenerator

I want my own app to generate my various routines at the gym

### Notes

> implement expo-router after finishing screens and back-end functionality

### To do

> rename icon directory and icons.tsx: they mean different things
> make addExerciseScreen design. consider: name, picture, weight/cardio, (Sets x Reps)/time

> context: routines generated
> firebase: store number of sets, weight, number of attempts, \*account/name
> basic framework:
> home screen: choose what work out day (button/drawer). big button to generate
> routine screen: ~5 items of workouts for the user. items can be selected to move to the details screen
> details screen: descriptive screen for selected video. Video, name, guide, number of sets, maybe alternatives
