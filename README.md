# GymRoutineGenerator

I want my own app to generate my various routines at the gym

### Notes

> maybe make a optional backend feature so the user can customize/remember what weight and number of sets they use

### To do

> rework to gym counter app
> basic framework:
> home screen: choose what work out day (button/drawer). big button to generate
> routine screen: ~5 items of workouts for the user. items can be selected to move to the details screen
> details screen: descriptive screen for selected video. Video, name, guide, number of sets, maybe alternatives
