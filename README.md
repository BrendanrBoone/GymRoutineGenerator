# GymRoutineGenerator

I want my own app to generate my various routines at the gym

### Notes

> maybe make a optional backend feature so the user can customize/remember what weight and number of sets they use
> experiment with routines in back-end
> CHANGE METHOD OF UTILIZING DEFINED ROUTINES. NEED MODULAR EXERCISE OBJECTS CATEGORIZED WITHIN THEM. THAT CAN BE ADDED AND EDITED WITHIN THE APP.

### To do

> add day selector on homeScreen
> create two different screens for RoutineScreen: one as a list, another as flashcards; button on top right to toggle between them; make routines stored in appcontext

> context: routines generated
> firebase: store number of sets, weight, number of attempts, account/name
> basic framework:
> home screen: choose what work out day (button/drawer). big button to generate
> routine screen: ~5 items of workouts for the user. items can be selected to move to the details screen
> details screen: descriptive screen for selected video. Video, name, guide, number of sets, maybe alternatives
